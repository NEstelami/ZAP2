It is said that the clouds  surrounding this peak reflect the condition of Death Mountain. When they look normal, it is at peace.  Climbing all the way up here just proves how smart you are! Now I want to see you make another smart move...  The Great Fairy lives on this mountaintop, and she will give you a new skill! She is the leader of the fairies, you know. Hoo!  I will perch here and wait for you. When you're ready to go back down, I can help you!  Now, get going!" },

If you are going back down the mountain, I can lend you a wing. Come here and grab my talons! And hold on tight! Hoo hooooooot!" },

The Master Sword--the evil- destroying sword that you pulled out of the Pedestal of Time--was  the final key to the Sacred Realm.  [Link]... Don't be alarmed... Look at yourself...!" },

He obtained the Triforce from the Temple of Light, and with its  power, he became the King of Evil...  His evil power radiated from the temples of Hyrule, and in seven short years, it transformed Hyrule into a world of monsters.  My power now has only little  influence, even in this Sacred Realm...  Namely, this Chamber of Sages.  But there is still hope...  The power of the Sages remains.  When the power of all the Sages is awakened...  The Sages' Seals will contain all the evil power in the void of  the Realm...  I, Rauru, am one of the Sages... And...  Your power to fight together with the Sages makes you the  Hero of Time!  The Hero of Time, chosen by the Master Sword!  Keep my spirit with you... And, find the power of the other Sages and add their might to your own!" },

Together with the Hero of Time,  the awakened ones will bind the evil and return the light of peace to the world...  This is the legend of the temples passed down by my people, the Sheikah." },

Now listen carefully..." },

{ 0x70F4, "Oh...you are quite an energetic young man. You're brave and handsome, too.  Heh heh heh...your name is [Link], isn't it.  Heh heh he...don't be surprised. I can read people's minds.  If I looked as good as you, I could run a different kind of  business...heh he heh...  My shop is the only Ghost Shop in Hyrule.  Because of the great Ganondorf,  it is a fine time for a business  like this...heh heh heh...  Oh...I can only hope the world  gets even worse!  The ghosts, called Poes, are  spirits of concentrated hatred  that appear in the fields and  graveyard. They hate the world!  Young man, if you catch a Poe, I will pay a lot of money for it... Heh heh hee!" },
{ 0x70F5, "Hey, young man. What's happening  today? If you have a Poe, I will  buy it.  Your card now has [!?] points. Come back again! Heh heh heh!" },
{ 0x70F6, "Oh, you brought a Poe today!  ........  Hmmm...  This is a normal Poe. Here are your 10 Rupees. Take them.  Heh heh." },
{ 0x70F7, "Oh, you brought a Poe today!  Hmmmm!  Very interesting! This is a Big Poe!  I'll buy it for 50 Rupees.  On top of that, I'll put 100 points on your card.  If you earn 1,000 points, you'll be a happy man! Heh heh." },
{ 0x70F8, "Wait a minute! WOW!  You have earned 1,000 points!  Young man, you are a genuine Ghost Hunter!  Is that what you expected me to say? Heh heh heh!  Because of you, I have extra inventory of Big Poes, so this will be the last time I can buy a  ghost.  You're thinking about what I  promised would happen when you earned 1,000 points. Heh heh.  Don't worry, I didn't forget. Just take this." },
{ 0x70F9, "Oh? What's that?  Is that..." },
{ 0x70FA, "a fairy?!  Then, are you... Are you from the forest?" },
{ 0x70FB, "Then...then...you wouldn't happen to have...the Spiritual Stone of the  Forest, would you?! That green  and shining stone..." },
{ 0x70FC, "I had a dream...In the dream, dark storm clouds were billowing over the land of Hyrule...  But suddenly, a ray of light shot out of the forest, parted the clouds and lit up the ground...  The light turned into a figure holding a green and shining stone, followed by a fairy..." },
{ 0x70FD, "I know this is a prophecy that someone would come from the forest...  Yes, I thought you might be the one..." },
{ 0x70FE, "Oh, I'm sorry!  I got carried away with my story  and didn't even properly introduce  myself!" },

{ 0x7102, "Yeeeah! Help me!" },
{ 0x7103, "Uh...yeah? So what?" },
{ 0x7104, "I hate foxes!" },
{ 0x7105, "How irritating!" },
{ 0x7106, "Hey, you look good!" },
{ 0x7107, "YEEEAH! What's your problem?!" },
{ 0x7108, "Oooh...is that a Zora? Those cool eyes are really fascinating..." },
{ 0x7109, "Oh no! You're scary! Don't come any closer!" },
{ 0x710A, "Wow...how nostalgic! That reminds me of when I was a little kid." },
{ 0x710B, "That's kind of funny...it makes me laugh! Hee hee!" },
{ 0x710C, "Uh-oh! I'm sorry, mom! Oh...hey, it's you! Don't scare me like that!" },
{ 0x710D, "What a big head you have!" },
{ 0x710E, "Oh, don't do that! I'm shy..." },
{ 0x710F, "Is there a mask competition going on?  I'm going to vote for you!" },
{ 0x7110, "Oh! A rabbit! Speaking of rabbits, I saw a  strange man chasing rabbits  around..." },
{ 0x7111, "Oooh, what a pretty lady! But you're kind of short, aren't you?" },
{ 0x7112, "Well...I can't think of anything funny to say...sorry, kid!" },
{ 0x7113, "A mask... When I was a little  kid, I also wore masks around... What? You say you can't imagine me doing that?" },
{ 0x7114, "Ohhhh...I see... It's an illusion..." },
{ 0x7115, "Hey, kid, don't grow up to be like me..." },
{ 0x7116, "AAAAAAAAAAAH! A GERUDO!!!!  Wha-? A mask? Why do you have a mask  like that?!" },
{ 0x7117, "Sorry, I'm busy right now." },
{ 0x7118, "Oh wow! It's Keaton! Hi, Keaton!" },
{ 0x7119, "How spooky! There's a boy in Kakariko Village who was looking for a mask like that!" },
{ 0x711A, "Hmm...well...don't you have any other masks?" },
{ 0x711B, "What a strange mask! Hee hah haa!" },
{ 0x711C, "Hey kid! Can't you see we're busy?! Leave us alone!" },
{ 0x711D, "I'm sorry. I don't even want to look at any other woman!" },
{ 0x711E, "Hee hee. Don't pay any attention to that kid, my dear... Just pretend we're in our own, private little world..." },
{ 0x711F, "Oh, please! Go bother someone  else!" },
{ 0x7120, "There's a rumor going around that there is a Potion Shop that can make the ultimate medicine!" },
{ 0x7121, "I heard a rumor that there is a  monster that eats Hylian Shields somewhere out there in the world. Have you ever seen it?" },
{ 0x7122, "I came here to sell bombs... Please buy some!" },
{ 0x7123, "I...I am afraid... I have a feeling that man is going to destroy Hyrule.  He has such terrifying power!  But it's fortunate that you have  come..." },
{ 0x7124, "What? If you want something, just make it clear!" },
{ 0x7125, "I'm busy! Get out of my way, you bum!" },
{ 0x7126, "Hey, you have some good, quality wood there, kid!" },
{ 0x7127, "Hrrrrm! Get out of my face! You good for nothin'..." },
{ 0x7128, "EEEEEEAAAAH! Whoops, I shouldn't scream like that or the boss will yell at me!" },
{ 0x7129, "Oh, sorry boss!  I didn't mean to slack off! I'll get busy!  Oh, that's not you, boss?" },
{ 0x712A, "Gerudos are beautiful and brave... They are just so fascinating!" },
{ 0x712B, "Someday, when I have more skill, I'll carve a mask like that one!" },
{ 0x712C, "Oh, that's the mask everyone is talking about! Looks kind of strange..." },
{ 0x712D, "Wa-ha-hah! How's business, Mr. Hero? Hah hah hah!" },
{ 0x712E, "I'm on duty. Understand? ON DUTY!" },
{ 0x712F, "Hmm, well, I don't really know what to say about that one..." },
{ 0x7130, "Oh wow! Cute! But Cuccos are much cuter!" },
{ 0x7131, "Eh, what? Are you sad? Happy? I really can't tell..." },
{ 0x7132, "I'm sorry, I'm not really interested in that." },
{ 0x7133, "The little kid playing in the graveyard was saying something about his face..." },
{ 0x7134, "I really am a good man. Don't you believe me?" },
{ 0x7135, "WHAAAA--! I thought you were that old hag! Don't scare me like that!" },
{ 0x7136, "I remember my father talking about a swordsmith...but that doesn't really matter to me anyway." },
{ 0x7137, "I'm not afraid of any forest  monsters! Are you trying to make fun of me?" },
{ 0x7138, "What is that? I can't see it very well from here..." },
{ 0x7139, "Hi again! How are you today?" },
{ 0x713A, "Everything's fine today!" },
{ 0x713B, "Tired...I'm so tired..." },
{ 0x713C, "I don't care about any foxes!" },
{ 0x713D, "That's irritating! It bothers my eyes!" },
{ 0x713E, "That looks quite handsome!" },
{ 0x713F, "Waaaaaaah! What is wrong with you? Do you have a bad attitude?" },
{ 0x7140, "You idiot!  When you talk to someone, you should make eye contact!" },
{ 0x7141, "You idiot! When you talk to someone, you shouldn't stare!" },
{ 0x7142, "You idiot! When you talk to someone, you should take off your mask!" },
{ 0x7143, "You idiot! I don't know why I'm calling you that, but...you are one!" },
{ 0x7144, "Where did you get that? What? It's a mask?" },
{ 0x7145, "Uh, leave me alone... Can't you see I'm in a groove right now?" },
{ 0x7146, "A mask is just like a musical  instrument--it reflects the character of its owner. I like your originality, kid!" },
{ 0x7147, "What a big head! How'd you fit through that door?!" },
{ 0x7148, "I HATE foxes, sonny!" },
{ 0x7149, "Now if that isn't the most irritating face I've seen in all my days, I don't know what is!" },
{ 0x714A, "Hey, that's a fine face you got there, sonny!" },
{ 0x714B, "Have you got any complaints? Speak up, then!" },
{ 0x714C, "Please quit playing around and dispel our curse!" },
{ 0x714D, "If I wore something like that... I'd be a real Skulltula... AAAAAAAAAAH!" },
{ 0x714E, "Please understand if I don't laugh... It's hard to be happy in this condition...  Being cursed and all..." },
{ 0x714F, "[sound 6867]Hyaaaaah! That's scary! I know I'm scary, but...man! That's really scary!" },
{ 0x7150, "Huh?! Wha--!  Oh, it's just a kid. Don't scare me like that! I may not look like it, but I'm a very sensitive guy!" },
{ 0x7151, "Well, will you lookit the noggin on  this kid! It's HUGE! Mine is huge too, though..." },
{ 0x7152, "Do you know what kind of mask you're wearing...? And you're still wearing it?" },
{ 0x7153, "I'm on duty now...  If you want me to dig, don't bother me." },
{ 0x7154, "What is that? It's something that hops around in a field... I forgot what those things are called..." },
{ 0x7155, "Hey! It's a Keaton Mask!! I asked my daddy to get me one, too!" },
{ 0x7156, "That's not very different from Mr. Damp?, is it?" },
{ 0x7157, "That doesn't look anything like Mr. Damp?, huh?" },
{ 0x7158, "[sound 6863]Hey, cool mask...but a little scary, don't you think?" },
{ 0x7159, "Hey! That looks familiar... I think I saw something like it in the Lost Woods, no?" },
{ 0x715A, "[sound 6863]That makes me feel...happy..." },
{ 0x715B, "Oh...uh...sniff... That mask... It makes me feel...sad..." },
{ 0x715C, "Hah! That mask won't do you any good! You're just afraid of me, the great Mido...aren't you?!" },
{ 0x715D, "Waaaaah! What? Hey, I'm not scared of you! Just don't come any closer, understand?!" },
{ 0x715E, "Hey, that's a cool mask. I want it! JUST KIDDING! Hah! I don't want that stupid mask!" },
{ 0x715F, "Wah hah ha hah! That really suits you!" },
{ 0x7160, "Waaaah! I-I'm gonna tell Mido about  this!" },
{ 0x7161, "Yeeeeah! I-I'm gonna tell Mido to beat you up!" },
{ 0x7162, "Whooooah! Are you some kind of forest ghost?" },
{ 0x7163, "That's so cool! Uh...don't tell Mido I said that!" },
{ 0x7164, "What?! You came back! I can tell who you are, even with that mask on!" },
{ 0x7165, "I wonder what Mido would say if he saw that? I really would like to see his reaction!" },
{ 0x7166, "I see... You're going to scare Mido with that mask, aren't you?!" },
{ 0x7167, "Hah hah hah! What a funny face! I bet Saria would think it's pretty funny, too!" },
{ 0x7168, "Tee hee hee! A mask made of wood? It looks like you're wearing a shield on your face!" },
{ 0x7169, "What a weird face!  Speaking of weird faces, one of the forest kids was complaining about his face..." },
{ 0x716A, "What an enormous head you have!" },
{ 0x716B, "Tee hee! Where did you get that? Outside the forest? No way! I don't believe it!" },
{ 0x716C, "Hee hee! Kind of funny, but it's not really my style..." },
{ 0x716D, "Right on!  Wearing this mask makes me feel really tough and scary! Hee hee!" },
{ 0x716E, "Hee hee! There sure are a lot of different people in the world!" },
{ 0x716F, "Hee hee! I don't need a new one... I like the one I have, thanks!" },
{ 0x7170, "[sound 686D]Wow, that makes your head look huge! Hee hee!" },
{ 0x7171, "[sound 686B]What a cute little mouse! What? Oh, it's not a mouse?" },
{ 0x7172, "[sound 686C]What are those floppy things on your head? Ears? That mask makes you look like you have four ears!" },
{ 0x7173, "[sound 6869]It must be exciting to sneak past the guards while wearing that mask!" },
{ 0x7174, "Hi, fairy boy! What? You think you're in disguise? But it's so obvious who you are!" },
{ 0x7175, "Wow! What big eyes you have! Gorons are so cute, aren't they!" },
{ 0x7176, "Oh, I know that character! It's Keaton! He's very hot in Hyrule Castle Town right now!" },
{ 0x7177, "Oh, brother! Boys will be boys!" },
{ 0x7178, "Wait...wait... I know who ya are... Yer... Kin-ton! Ain't that right?!" },
{ 0x7179, "That's a scary one, ain't it? Almost as scary as...Ingo!" },
{ 0x717A, "Hey, that reminds me of my wife... On second thought, it doesn't... It doesn't look like her at all!" },
{ 0x717B, "YAAAWWN... I'm kinda tired right now... Show it to me later..." },
{ 0x717C, "Scram, kid! Can't you see I'm busy?!" },
{ 0x717D, "Humph! It's fine to play like that when  you're a kid, but just wait until you grow up! Work, work, work!" },
{ 0x717E, "YEOW! Humph. It's just a mask... Scram, kid! Get out of here!" },
{ 0x717F, "Heh heh heh... Well, that cheered me up a little, kid. Thanks!" },
{ 0x7180, "Hmmm... Let's see... Yes, I'm quite sure of it... That was manufactured from a  plank from a coffin. Yes, it was!" },
{ 0x7181, "Ahhh...yes. Let's see... Very fine craftsmanship. But I don't think it would make a good ingredient for my medicine." },
{ 0x7182, "Very interesting! A Goron! Speaking of Gorons, I wonder how my old friend, Biggoron of Death Mountain, is doing?" },
{ 0x7183, "Very unusual construction... I don't think it's water soluble, so it wouldn't make a good  ingredient for my medicines..." },
{ 0x7184, "Chomp chomp chomp... OK, OK, a mask. Do you want to buy some beans?" },
{ 0x7185, "Chomp chomp chomp... Nope, I don't want to buy it." },
{ 0x7186, "Chomp chomp chomp... Nope, it's not my style." },
{ 0x7187, "Chomp chomp chomp... Well...no, I don't think I  want it." },
{ 0x7188, "What do you want?" },
{ 0x7189, "You don't look like you can swim very well..." },
{ 0x718A, "Red hair...tan skin... I've seen people like that before..." },
{ 0x718B, "Yeah, right. You look a little small for a Zora..." },
{ 0x718C, "Ho ho ho! You Hylians...you are such silly creatures!" },
{ 0x718D, "That face...it gives me the chills..." },
{ 0x718E, "Talk about a nostalgia trip! That reminds me of my childhood friend, Biggoron!" },
{ 0x718F, "I don't think that's funny at all. Are you mocking me?" },
{ 0x7190, "You're a funny guy!" },
{ 0x7191, "Your head--it's gigantic!" },
{ 0x7192, "Don't do that... It's embarrassing me!" },
{ 0x7193, "All right! You actually decided to become a Zora! Are you actually ready to marry me now?" },
{ 0x7194, "WHOA! My heart...started to beat  so fast!" },
{ 0x7195, "That's an unpleasant mask... Good-bye." },
{ 0x7196, "Hrrrrm... I don't know what to say." },
{ 0x7197, "You shouldn't be so picky about what you eat! Do you eat all your green rocks? If you don't, you  won't grow up big and strong!" },
{ 0x7198, "Leave me alone!" },
{ 0x7199, "Are you trying to make me laugh? Well, that's not that funny..." },
{ 0x719A, "You're making me mad!" },
{ 0x719B, "I hate Gerudos!!" },
{ 0x719C, "Quit pestering me! Go away!" },
{ 0x719D, "Wah hah hah! Do you think you're in disguise? How funny!" },
{ 0x719E, "Out of my way! Get out of here! You're asking for it, aren't you?" },
{ 0x719F, "Hey, kid, you've got guts coming around here wearing that! Still, you can't fool us that easily!" },
{ 0x71A0, "What is that? What does it have to do with us?" },
{ 0x71A1, "Ha ha hah! You've got guts to spare, don't you kid?  I like you!" },
{ 0x71A2, "C'mon! It's time to get serious!" },
{ 0x71A3, "That's odd...it kind of looks like me... No...not really. Not at all, if you look at it closely." },
{ 0x71A4, "Hmm. No, no, no! The ears aren't right at all! They should be, you know, longer!" },
{ 0x71A5, "Aren't you kind of scared,  walking around in the middle of the night looking like that?" },
{ 0x71A6, "Ha ha hah! You really like those things, don't you?!" },
{ 0x71A7, "I think I've seen a stone that looks like that somewhere... Now where was that? Hmmmm...." },
{ 0x71A8, "Hurry up, [Link]! Any second now, the tower is  going to collapse!!" },
{ 0x71A9, "Watch out for falling rubble!" },
{ 0x71AA, "[Link]! Help me!" },
{ 0x71AB, "[Link]! The exit is just over there!" },
{ 0x71AC, "Thank you, [Link]. Now, let's hurry!" },
{ 0x71AD, "Too bad!  Practice hard and come back!" },
{ 0x71AE, "Almost!!  Well...all right! I'll let you try one more time for free... This time, you gotta do it!" },
{ 0x71AF, "Wonderful!!! Bravo!!! Perfect!!!  Here's a fantastic present!" },
{ 0x71B0, "Oh, no! Time's up! The thing you were going to  deliver has spoiled! Let's try again!" },
{ 0x71B1, "BOINNG! BOINNG! The current time is: [World Time]!" },
{ 0x71B2, "You heard about us from the guard at Death Mountain gate? Well, I have to give you a good deal then!" },
